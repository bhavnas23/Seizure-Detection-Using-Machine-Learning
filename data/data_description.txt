This database, collected at the Children’s Hospital Boston, consists of EEG recordings from pediatric subjects with intractable seizures. Subjects were monitored for up to several days following withdrawal of anti-seizure medication in order to characterize their seizures and assess their candidacy for surgical intervention.

The sampling rate of the data was 173.61 Hz. The time series have the spectral bandwidth of the acquisition system, which is 0.5 Hz to 85 Hz. The dataset consists of five sets: Set B, Set C and Set E.

Set B refers to healthy data
Set C refers to Inter-ictal (transition between healthy to seizure) data
Set E is of ictal or seizures.
